## Portfolio:
I’m a software developer with over ten years of experience, starting my journey with Unity3D and C#, a combination I continue to work with today. My background has given me a solid understanding of object-oriented programming, software architecture, and system design.

Along the way, I’ve gained experience with MySQL for database management, JSON for data storage and communication, and Vue.js for building modern and efficient frontend interfaces. I use Git daily for version control and collaborative workflows, ensuring consistency and reliability across development environments.

Over the years, I’ve grown from contributing to small development teams to coordinating and supporting larger, more complex projects involving multiple resources. I focus on writing clean, maintainable code, fostering good communication within teams, and designing solutions that are both scalable and sustainable over time.


## Something about me:
* 🎮 💻 I'm currently working as a Lead Software Developer in a team of 8 members helping out with scalability and training Junior members on the team.
* 🚵‍♂️ I like the mountains and nature.
* 🥊 🏃 🚴‍♂️ 🧗‍♂️ I practice a lot of sports.


## Special Thanks and Support 🙇
Everything you can find on my GitHub profile are made in my free time, thanks to anyone that find the time to help me out and contribute  🙏
